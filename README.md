Note: LSTM not effective in multiplication <br>
In their highly influential work on deep learning [3], Hochreiter et al. demonstrated that LSTMs
are remarkably suited for performing such tasks as addition, excelling under the inherent ability to
selectively ‘remember’ certain states of the input in previous timesteps. They thus propound the
structure of a new network and show that it can obtain remarkable outputs under various testing
conditions. However, they note that the model does not excel in <strong>multiplication-related tasks.</strong><br>
